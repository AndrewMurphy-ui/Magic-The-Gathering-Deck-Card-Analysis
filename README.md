# MTGProject

## Overview
MTGProject is a data analysis project focused on analyzing and visualizing Magic: The Gathering (MTG) card data. The project leverages ETL pipelines, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques to gain insights into MTG card attributes, rarity distributions, and game mechanics.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Collects MTG card data from official APIs and other sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans, normalizes, and structures the data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Performs statistical analysis on card attributes, color distributions, and trends over time.
- **Visualization**: Generates charts and graphs to highlight key findings.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: SQLite or ArangoDB (if applicable)
- **APIs**: MTGGoldfish API (for card data retrieval)
